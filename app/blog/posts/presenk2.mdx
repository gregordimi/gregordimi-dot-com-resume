# The Mighty Rodopa Mountain 2023

The year is 2023, and after a year of preparation and the unsuccessful but very insightful attempt of 2022, I am ready to face the Wild Boar Ultra again. This time I was more prepared as I knew what to expect. I was more confident and ready to face the challenge. The weather was perfect, and the mountain was calling me. I was ready to face the challenge.

I have fixed everything that I thought was wrong with my previous attempt. I had better gear, better nutrition, and all of the minor hiccups like headlight, backpack organization, and so on were fixed. I had gained some weight, but I was confident that it wouldn't be a problem.

From the start, I knew I was in trouble as my HR was substantially higher than it should be if I wanted to sustain it for 100 km. After the second major descent, I started feeling a creeping pain in my right knee which was slowly turning into a sharp pain.

I was feeling great, with no extraordinary pain, so I got a beer and started thinking about how to defeat this race next year. Here's the plan:

1. Skip one year
2. Go down to 77 kilos
3. Train elevation gain
4. Train descent
5. Train terrains
6. Add strength training for foot arches, ankles, knees, and hips
7. Make a dry run and plan every segment of the race
8. Take the course effortlessly

So let's celebrate not a single equipment failure or injury in 2023.
